# Kube Controller Manager

  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/kube-controller-manager/)
  
In this section, we will take a look at kube-controller-manager.

#### Kube Controller Manager manages various controllers in kubernetes.
- In kubernetes terms, a controller is a process that continuously monitors the state of the components within the system and works towards bringing the whole system to the desired functioning state.

## Node Controller
   - Responsible for monitoring the state of the Nodes and taking necessary actions to keep the application running.

## Replication Controller
   - It is responsible for monitoring the status of replicasets and ensuring that the desired number of pods are available at all time within the set.

  ## Installing Kube-Controller-Manager
  - When you install kube-controller-manager the different controllers will get installed as well.
  - Download the kube-controller-manager binary from the kubernetes release page. For example: You can download kube-controller-manager v1.13.0 here [kube-controller-manager](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.13.0/bin/linux/amd64/kube-controller-manager)
    ```
    $ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.13.0/bin/linux/amd64/kube-controller-manager
    ```
  - By default all controllers are enabled, but you can choose to enable specific one from **`kube-controller-manager.service`**
    ```
    $ cat /etc/systemd/system/kube-controller-manager.service
    ```

## View kube-controller-manager - kubeadm
- kubeadm deploys the kube-controller-manager as a pod in kube-system namespace
  ```
  $ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
  ```

## View kube-controller-manager options - kubeadm
- You can see the options within the pod located at **`/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml`**
  ```
  $ cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
  ```
  ![kube-controller-manager1](../../images/kube-controller-manager1.PNG)
  
## View kube-controller-manager options - Manual
- In a non-kubeadm setup, you can inspect the options by viewing the **`kube-controller-manager.service`**
  ```
  $ cat /etc/systemd/system/kube-controller-manager.service
  ```
  ![kube-controller-manager2](../../images/kube-controller-manager2.PNG)
  
- You can also see the running process and effective options by listing the process on master node and searching for kube-controller-manager.
  ```
  $ ps -aux | grep kube-controller-manager
  ```
