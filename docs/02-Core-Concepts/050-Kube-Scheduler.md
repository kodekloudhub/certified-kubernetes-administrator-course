# Kube Scheduler
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/kube-scheduler/)

In this section, we will take a look at kube-scheduler.

#### kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on nodes.  
- The kube-scheduler is only responsible for deciding which pod goes on which node. It doesn't actually place the pod on the nodes, that's the job of the **`kubelet`**.

## View kube-scheduler options - kubeadm
- If you set it up with kubeadm tool, kubeadm tool will deploy the kube-scheduler as pod in kube-system namespace on master node.
