  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/courses/539883/lectures/9808162)

In this section, we will take a look at kube-scheduler.

#### kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on nodes.  
- The kube-scheduler is only responsible for deciding which pod goes on which node. It doesn't actually place the pod on the nodes, thats the job of the **`kubelet`**.
