# Kubernetes Services
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/courses/539883/lectures/9808156)
  
In this section we will take a look at **`services`** in kubernetes

## Services
- Kubernetes Services enables communication between various components within and outside of the application.

#### Let's look at some other aspects of networking

## External Communication

- How do we as an **`external user`** access the **`web page`**?

  - From the node (Able to reach the application as expected)

  - From outside world (This should be our expectation, without something in the middle it will not reach the application)

 ## Service Types
 
 #### There are 3 types of service types in kubernetes
 
   ![srv-types](../../images/srv-types.PNG)
 
 1. NodePort
    - Where the service makes an internal POD accessible on a POD on the NODE.
      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
       name: myapp-service
      spec:
       types: NodePort
       ports:
       - targetPort: 80
         port: 80
         nodePort: 30008
      ```
     ![srvnp](../../images/srvnp.PNG)
      
      #### To connect the service to the pod
      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
       name: myapp-service
      spec:
       types: NodePort
       ports:
       - targetPort: 80
         port: 80
         nodePort: 30008
       selector:
         app: myapp
         type: front-end
       ```

    ![srvnp1](../../images/srvnp1.PNG)
      
      #### To create the service
      ```
      $ kubectl create -f service-definition.yaml
      ```
      
      #### To list the services
      ```
      $ kubectl get services
      ```
      
      #### To access the application from CLI instead of web browser
      ```
      $ curl http://192.168.1.2:30008
      ```
      
      ![srvnp2](../../images/srvnp2.PNG)

      #### A service with multiple pods
      
      ![srvnp3](../../images/srvnp3.PNG)
      
      #### When Pods are distributed across multiple nodes

 1. ClusterIP
    - In this case the service creates a **`Virtual IP`** inside the cluster to enable communication between different services such as a set of frontend servers to a set of backend servers.
    
 1. LoadBalancer
    - Where the service provisions a **`loadbalancer`** for our application in supported cloud providers.
