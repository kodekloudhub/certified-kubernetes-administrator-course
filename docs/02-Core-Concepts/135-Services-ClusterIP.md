# Kubernetes Services - ClusterIP
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/services-cluster-ip-2/)
  
In this section we will take a look at **`services - ClusterIP`** in kubernetes
         
## ClusterIP
- In this case the service creates a **`Virtual IP`** inside the cluster to enable communication between different services such as a set of frontend servers to a set of backend servers.

#### What is a right way to establish connectivity between these services or tiers  
- A kubernetes service can help us group the pods together and provide a single interface to access the pod in a group.
