# Introduction to Docker Storage

  - Take me to [Lecture](https://kodekloud.com/topic/introduction-to-docker-storage-3/)
  
In this section, we will take a look at **Docker storage**.

- To understand storage in the container orchestration tools like **Kubernetes**, It is important to first understand how storage works with containers. Understanding how storage works with **Docker** first and getting all the basics right will later make it so much easier to understand how it works in **Kubernetes**.

- If you are new to **Docker** then you can learn some basics of docker from the course [Docker for the absolute beginner course](https://kodekloud.com/courses/docker-for-the-absolute-beginner/), that is free.
