# Kubeadm Cluster Installations

In this section we present various labs for building kubeadm clusters

* AWS - Using KodeKloud AWS Playground

    In these labs terraform is used to provision the virtual machines, leaving you to configure the cluster.
    * [3 Node Cluster](./aws/)
    * [5 Node Highly Available Cluster](./aws-ha/)

* Apple Silicon

    For users of Mac M1/M2, this is a lab that provisions a 2 or 3 node cluster (depending on how much memory your Mac has) using [Multipass](https://multipass.run/).

    * [2/3 Node Cluster](./apple-silicon/)

* Vagrant and VirtualBox

    For users of Windows and Mac x86, provision a 3 node cluster on your laptop.

    * [3 Node Cluster](./virtualbox/)
