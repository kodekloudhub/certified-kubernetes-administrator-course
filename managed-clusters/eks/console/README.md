# EKS cluster using the Console

Last updated: December 2024

Create an EKS cluster using the KodeKloud AWS Playground's console. Due to policy restrictions in the playground, it is important to follow these instructions *to the letter*. Do not change any names for things like the cluster or role names or it will not work.
