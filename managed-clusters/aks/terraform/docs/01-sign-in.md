Copy the **Console Link** by pressing the copy button to the right of it, paste to your browser and sign in with the given credentials. If you are given a choice of accounts like in the following dialog, select **Use another account**

1. Now copy the `Password` and paste it as Temporary Access Pass.

Skip all the usage and Start a Tour stuff, unless you're interested in that.
